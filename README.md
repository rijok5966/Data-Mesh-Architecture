# Data Mesh Architecture

## Overview
  This project explores the paradigm shift brought about by Data Mesh architecture in data management and analytics. It evaluates the shortcomings of traditional architectures like Data Warehouses and Data Lakes and discusses how Data Mesh addresses these issues through decentralization, domain-oriented ownership, and treating data as a product. The literature review also highlights the benefits, challenges, and real-world applications of Data Mesh, offering insights into its potential for improving data-driven decision-making in organizations.

## Key Highlights
  - Objective: Analyze the principles, advantages, and limitations of Data Mesh architecture compared to traditional data architectures.
  - Key Focus Areas:
    -  The shift from centralized to decentralized domain ownership.
    - Treating data as a product to improve accessibility and usability.
    - Self-serve data infrastructure for empowering domain teams.
    - Federated governance to balance autonomy and consistency.
    - Comparative Analysis: Detailed comparison of Data Mesh with Data Warehouses, Data Lakes, and Data Lakehouses.
